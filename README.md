# table-recipes-api
A rudimentary REST API made with Node.js to power my recipe website - [table.recipes](https://table.recipes)

The goal of table.recipes is to provide a barebones, unobtrusive recipe website for users to enter in recipes that they frequently revisit. 

As someone who loves to cook and bake, I have several sources for recipes, whether it is my collection of books, re-watching Youtube videos step-by-step, or visiting one of the many other recipe sites out there. I wanted a place to put all of my most frequently used recipes for easy access while I'm in the kitchen.

Some may ask, "Why not use one of the many recipe sites that are already out there?" The answer for me comes down to how easy it is to access my recipes and the bloat of many of the recipe sites that are out there. 

I want to provide a quiet, easy-going experience for those who just want to archive their favorite foods!

## things that are in-progress for me:

- Review the current mongodb schema to improve it
- Implement a 'favorite' system for recipes
- Implement keyset pagination when retrieving documents
- User signup/login logic (JWT-based)
- Create the frontend (probably Svelte)

## do you see any issues or areas where I can improve?
You are more than welcome to let me know, whether that be by creating issues or submitting PR's or however else you'd like to let me know! I am always open to others' comments.
